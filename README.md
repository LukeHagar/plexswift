An Open API Spec for interacting with Plex.tv and Plex Servers

## Requirements

The SDK supports iOS 13 and later.


## üèó **Welcome to your new SDK!** üèó

It has been generated successfully based on your OpenAPI spec. However, it is not yet ready for production use. Here are some next steps:
- [ ] üõ† Make your SDK feel handcrafted by [customizing it](https://www.speakeasyapi.dev/docs/customize-sdks)
- [ ] ‚ôªÔ∏è Refine your SDK quickly by iterating locally with the [Speakeasy CLI](https://github.com/speakeasy-api/speakeasy)
- [ ] üéÅ Publish your SDK to package managers by [configuring automatic publishing](https://www.speakeasyapi.dev/docs/productionize-sdks/publish-sdks)
- [ ] ‚ú® When ready to productionize, delete this section from the README

<!-- Start SDK Installation [installation] -->
## SDK Installation

### Swift Package Manager

You can add `plexswift` to your project directly in Xcode `(File > Add Packages...)` or by adding it to your project's Package.swift file:

```bash
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/LukeHagar/plexswift.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.0.1"))
]
```
<!-- End SDK Installation [installation] -->

<!-- Start SDK Example Usage [usage] -->
## SDK Example Usage

### Example

```swift
import Foundation
import Plexswift

let client = Client(security: .accessToken("<YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>"))

let response = try await client.server.getServerCapabilities()

switch response.data {
case .twoHundredApplicationJsonObject(let twoHundredApplicationJsonObject):
    // Handle response
    break
case .fourHundredAndOneApplicationJsonObject(let fourHundredAndOneApplicationJsonObject):
    // Handle response
    break
case .empty:
    // Handle empty response
    break
}

```
<!-- End SDK Example Usage [usage] -->

<!-- Start Available Resources and Operations [operations] -->
## Available Resources and Operations


<!-- End Available Resources and Operations [operations] -->

<!-- Start Authentication [security] -->
## Authentication

### Global Security Schemes

The SDK supports the following security scheme globally through the `Shared.Security` type:

| Name           | Type           | Scheme         |
| -------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| `.accessToken` | apiKey         | API key        |

You can set the appropriate security parameters by passing a `Shared.Security` value for the `security` parameter when initializing the `Client` instance. For example:

```swift
import Foundation
import Plexswift

let client = Client(security: .accessToken("<YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>"))

let response = try await client.server.getServerCapabilities()

switch response.data {
case .twoHundredApplicationJsonObject(let twoHundredApplicationJsonObject):
    // Handle response
    break
case .fourHundredAndOneApplicationJsonObject(let fourHundredAndOneApplicationJsonObject):
    // Handle response
    break
case .empty:
    // Handle empty response
    break
}

```
<!-- End Authentication [security] -->

<!-- Placeholder for Future Speakeasy SDK Sections -->

# Development

## Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

## Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release!
